Hello Friends, My name is Rishabh Ostwal.

This is my first repository in GitHub. I made a star pattern as you can clearly see the name of the repository...

As you can see the image entitled "star_pattern.png" how the given code works.

Now to use the code first download or copy/paste the "STAR.txt" file, whatever you fill easy for you, then go to your bin folder or the location you have set for your c++ program,
In my case it is " C:\TC\BIN\ " then paste the file and then change it's extension from .txt to .cpp .

Now All Set :-)

Now Open your IDE and then open this file "star.cpp" and then run it.

You good to go then :)

If you like my repository then don't forget to follow me and also share with your friends also if you have any queries then feel free to contact me.
